# CIDME-Explorer

(ALPHA!  INCOMPLETE!).  Uses the [CIDME-JS](http://github.com/cidme/CIDME-JS) package.

An alpha stage, barely usable, UX poor, proof-of-concept cross-platform Cordova app demonstrating a User Interface (UI) for visual CIDME Entity manipulation. 

Currently has only been tested/used with the following platforms:
- Browser
- Android
